# Syzsuzy's Personal Website

This is the repository where I host my personal website from. This website was built using the Leap day template.

*Leap day is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day), or even use it today.*
